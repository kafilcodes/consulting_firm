**II. Smart Features, Automation & AI (Low/No Cost Focus)**

* **AI Chatbot (Initial Triage):** Use a free-tier service like Google Dialogflow ES (often has a generous free tier for basic text interactions) or an open-source framework. It can handle FAQs, basic service inquiries, and guide users before handing off to a human employee for complex negotiation or order processing.
* **Automated Notifications:** Use Firebase Cloud Functions triggered by database changes (e.g., order status updates, new messages) to send automated in-app and email notifications. Use free/low-cost email providers like SendGrid or Mailgun (check free tier limits).
* **Rule-Based Automation:** Implement simple logic in Cloud Functions. E.g., If an order for "Service X" is created, automatically create a standard checklist task list within the order document.
* **Template Generation:** Use libraries like `docx` (for Word) or simple string templating for generating basic documents/emails based on order data within Cloud Functions.
* **Puppeteer (Cautious Approach):** As mentioned, running Puppeteer directly in Cloud Functions can be costly/complex.
    * *Alternative 1:* Build small, local Electron/Node.js apps that *employees* run on their machines. The web app could provide the necessary data, and the local app performs the automation. Less centralized, but avoids server costs/complexity initially.
    * *Alternative 2:* Use Google Cloud Run. It's better suited for running browser instances but has a different pricing model (pay for CPU time). Still requires cost monitoring.
    * *Alternative 3:* Look for official APIs provided by the government portals you need to interact with â€“ this is the most robust and reliable method if available.
* **Data Analytics (Basic):** Leverage Firestore's querying capabilities and aggregate data in Cloud Functions for basic admin dashboard stats. For complex visualization, you might export data periodically to Google Sheets (manual/scripted) or look into the free tier of Google Data Studio.

**III. System Design & Firebase Implementation (Low Cost, Efficient)**

This design prioritizes Firebase's strengths and aims to minimize costs, especially reads/writes to Firestore.

* **Authentication:** **Firebase Authentication**. Perfect fit, secure, scalable, generous free tier. Use Email/Password and Google Sign-In. Store user roles (client, employee, admin) in a custom claim *or* in their Firestore user profile document.
* **Database:** **Cloud Firestore (Native Mode)**.
    * **Key Collections:**
        * `users`: { userId (auth uid), email, name, role ('client'/'employee'/'admin'), phone, createdAt, associatedEmployeeId (for client), expertiseAreas (for employee) }
        * `services`: { serviceId, name, description, category, standardPrice, deliverables, isActive }
        * `orders`: { orderId, clientId, clientName (denormalized), assignedEmployeeId, employeeName (denormalized), serviceId, serviceName (denormalized), status, createdAt, updatedAt, price (agreed), paymentStatus, requiredDocsList, uploadedDocs [ { name, url } ], timelineEst }
        * `chats`: Use subcollections for efficiency: `orders/{orderId}/messages` { messageId, senderId, receiverId, text, timestamp, isRead } OR a top-level collection `chats` { chatId (e.g., orderId or userId1_userId2), lastMessage, participants [userId1, userId2] } with a subcollection `messages`. The subcollection approach under orders might be simpler for order-specific chat.
        * `meetings`: { meetingId, clientId, employeeId, scheduledTime, duration, status ('scheduled', 'completed', 'cancelled'), videoCallLink, price }
        * `employees`: { employeeId (matches user uid), name, email, phone, areasOfExpertise [ ], assignedOrdersCount, availabilityCalendar [ { start, end } ] } (Keep sensitive HR/payroll data separate or minimal initially).
        * `careers`: { applicationId, applicantName, email, phone, positionApplied, cvUrl, status ('new', 'reviewed', 'rejected', ...), submittedAt }
        * `notifications`: { notificationId, userId, message, type, isRead, createdAt, link (e.g., to order/chat) }
        * `invoices`: { invoiceId, orderId, clientId, amount, status ('pending', 'paid', 'overdue'), dueDate, pdfUrl }
    * **Minimizing Reads/Writes:**
        * **Denormalization:** Store essential, rarely changing data directly where needed (e.g., `clientName` in `orders`) to avoid extra lookups. Update denormalized data using Cloud Functions when the source changes (e.g., if a user updates their name).
        * **Real-time Listeners (`onSnapshot`):** Use *only* where essential: active chat windows, real-time order status updates on the dashboard. Avoid listeners for large lists.
        * **Fetch on Demand:** Load lists (like order history) page by page (pagination) when the user navigates there.
        * **Cloud Functions:** Perform complex queries, aggregations (e.g., calculating total sales), and data updates server-side. Trigger functions on database events (onCreate, onUpdate) or via HTTPS callable functions from the client.
        * **Security Rules:** Crucial for both security AND cost. Ensure users can only read/write data they are authorized for. This prevents fetching unnecessary data. `allow read: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.clientId || request.auth.uid == resource.data.assignedEmployeeId || get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';` (Example for orders).
        * **Client-Side Caching:** Cache static data like service lists or user profiles locally in the browser for short periods.
* **File Storage:** **Firebase Storage**. Ideal for user uploads (CVs, order documents). Structure folders logically (e.g., `/userDocs/{userId}/{orderId}/{filename}`, `/cvs/{applicationId}/{filename}`). Use Security Rules to protect access. Generous free tier.
* **Backend Logic:** **Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js)**. Trigger functions based on Auth events (e.g., new user signup), Firestore events (e.g., order created), HTTP requests (for APIs like Razorpay webhooks), and scheduled events (e.g., payment reminders). Start within the free tier.
* **Hosting:** **Firebase Hosting**. Fast, secure CDN, custom domains, generous free tier. Perfect for hosting the React/Vue/Angular frontend.
* **Video Calls:** Integrate a third-party service.
    * *Low Cost:* Look at Jitsi as a Service options, or APIs like Whereby, Daily.co (check free/low tiers). Avoid building WebRTC from scratch. Generate unique meeting links via Cloud Function when a meeting is booked/started.
* **Payment Gateway:** **Razorpay**. Integrate using their Web Standard Checkout or Custom UI options. Handle payment success/failure callbacks using Cloud Functions to update order/invoice status in Firestore. Store API keys securely in Cloud Functions environment variables.

**IV. Workflow, Security & Efficiency**

* **Flow:** Client Browses -> Chats/Negotiates (Optional) -> Creates Order -> (Admin/Employee Approval - Optional) -> Client Pays (Advance/Full) -> Employee Accepts & Works -> Updates Status (& Chats if needed) -> Client Notified -> (Remaining Payment) -> Order Complete -> Invoice Generated.
* **Security:**
    * **Firebase Security Rules:** Your first line of defense. Define rules meticulously for Firestore and Storage.
    * **Input Validation:** Validate all data on both client-side and server-side (in Cloud Functions).
    * **Authentication:** Enforce authentication for all sensitive actions.
    * **Role Management:** Use custom claims or Firestore document data to enforce roles.
    * **API Keys:** Never expose API keys (Razorpay, etc.) on the client-side. Keep them in Cloud Functions environment variables.
    * **Secure Document Access:** Use Firebase Storage security rules based on user ID and order association. Generate temporary signed URLs if needed for limited-time access.
* **Efficiency:**
    * **Minimize Firebase Costs:** As detailed in the Firestore section (listeners, denormalization, functions, rules).
    * **Frontend Performance:** Code splitting, lazy loading components, optimizing bundle size (for React/Vue/Angular).
    * **Backend Performance:** Write efficient Cloud Functions (avoid long cold starts where possible, optimize database queries).
    * **Clear UI/UX:** An intuitive interface reduces user errors and support requests.
